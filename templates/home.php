        I'm a software developer & technology evangelist from NYC.
        Iâ€™ve been an explorer of the digital space for over a decade. From helping to design and build custom user interfaces, to creating advanced backend applications that aggregate and collect data, my passion is using software to help change the way people interact with the world around them.
